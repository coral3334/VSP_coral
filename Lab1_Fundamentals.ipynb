        "Jupyter notebooks allows cells to be interpreted as either code or Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight formatting language. In fact, what you're reading right now is written in Markdown. The syntax is very simple and a reference for common commands can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Use this reference guide to complete the following steps:\n",

        "4. Using the reference guide, figure out how to make ordered and unordered lists. Using an unordered list, list three of the things you hope to learn from this class.\n",
        "5. Sometimes, we want to reference specific code or code objects in the text of Markdown. Markdown allows us to format such reference so that it appears in a gray box (e.g. `x=3`). Using the reference guide, figure out how to format code and format  x = 3, so it has a gray box around it in the cell you created."
