If the larger range takes, for example, 100 times longer, it indicates that the function's execution time is directly related to the size of the range.

The divisible_by_n() function uses a list comprehension that checks each element in the iterable (range_values) to determine if it is divisible by n. Since lists and ranges are both iterable objects in Python, the function will correctly process a list in the same way it processes a range. The primary difference is that a list occupies more memory if it contains many elements compared to a range, which generates elements on-the-fly. This could affect memory usage, but the function logic itself remains the same."
